# Codebook: Hoppy Specter Brewery Analysis


### Data Sets

The Hoppy Specter Analysis relies on two files contained in the <data> directory. These include: 

* Beers.csv 
  + Contains information about individual beers. 
* Breweries.csv
  + Contains informationa bout breweries producing beers. 
  
```{r}
#Read in the beers and breweries files
  Beers = read.csv("data/Beers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  Breweries = read.csv("data/Breweries.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
  
### Variable Names: 

Initial variable names found in the data sets are: 

#### Beers.csv Variables: 

1. Name -- Specifies the Beer Name

2. Beer_ID -- A unique identifier for the individual beer

3. ABV -- Alcohol By Volume -- The value of alcohol in a beer by volume. Multiplying this number by 100% gives percent alcohol by volume. 
  + If NA the value is missing. 

4. IBU -- International Bitterness Units -- A numerical score used to evaluate the bitterness of individual beers. 
  + If NA the value is missing. 
  
5. Brewery_id -- Unique identifier for the brewery that makes the beer. 
  
6. Style -- Presents the style of beer according to customary standards

7. Ounces -- Default packaging size

```{r}
  names(Beers)
```

#### Breweries.csv Variables: 

1. Brew_id -- Unique identifier for the brewery

2. Name -- Specifies the name of the brewery

3. City -- Specifies the City in which the brewery is located

4. State -- Specifies the Abbreviation of the State in which the brewery is located

```{r}
  names(Breweries)
```

#### Data preparation: 

The State records in the Breweries data have undesired white space in each record. We will remove that here. 

```{r}
Breweries$State = trimws(Breweries$State)
```


#### Combined Variable Table

In order to utilize these variables, we will normalize them and merge the data set here. 

```{r}
# Set a common Brewery ID variable to merge on: 

names(Breweries)[1] = "Brewery_id"

# Merge the two dataframes

MergedBrewing = merge(Beers,Breweries, by = "Brewery_id")

# Fix the names conflict

names(MergedBrewing)[2] = "Beer_Name"
names(MergedBrewing)[8] = "Brewery_Name"
head(MergedBrewing)
```

The final data frame contains the variables and types as follows: 

```{r}
variableName = names(MergedBrewing)
types = sapply(MergedBrewing,class)
variables = rbind (variableName,types)
knitr::kable(variables)
```
