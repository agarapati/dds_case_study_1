### Purpose of this Analysis: 

The Hoppy Specter Brewery is looking to expand into a new U.S. State with their world-renowned heavily hopped "Pale as a Ghost" pale ale. Given the overwhelming bitterness of both their ethos and beer, they need to find the best home for their new location. They've asked Unique Consulting Svcs., LLC. to help them identify the new location.
